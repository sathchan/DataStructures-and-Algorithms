## System Design

Systems design implies a systematic approach to the design of a system. It may take a bottom-up or top-down approach, but either way the process is systematic wherein it takes into account all related components or modules of the system that needs to be created—from the architecture, to the required hardware and software, right down to the data and how it travels and transforms throughout its travel through the system. 

Important System Design Principles are but are not limited to-

		○ Identification of right Algorithms and Data Structures
		○ Decomposition - Split into Manageable and Reusable components. The design patterns are considered with finding good ways to achieve code-reuse
		○ Scalability - All components must be Horizontally scalable. Consider parallelism wherever useful.
		○ Execution Time - System running time
		○ Extensible
		○ Testable
		○ Security
	
	Some of the Architecture tenants are - 
	
		○ Cloud
		○ Multi-tenant
		○ Failures (Fault Tolerance and Resiliency)
		○ Availability (HA, DR) – Always On Architecture 
		○ Performance
		○ Asynchronous 
		○ Automation, Infrastructure as Code
		○ Continuous Integration and Deployment
		○ Operations, Monitoring
		○ Instrumentation
		○ Flighting - Feature Parity
