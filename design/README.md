## System Design

Systems design implies a systematic approach to the design of a system. It may take a bottom-up or top-down approach, but either way the process is systematic wherein it takes into account all related components or modules of the system that needs to be createdâ€”from the architecture, to the required hardware and software, right down to the data and how it travels and transforms throughout its travel through the system.
